# xv6-os

## Why xv6 ?

I was so interested in the world of UNIX operating systems that I've decided to learn [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public). It is not a trivial things to learn, there are many resources online covers this operating system in details (line-by-line in [this repo](https://github.com/palladian1/xv6-annotated/edit/main/README.md)). But reading through this for the first time feels a little bit hard for me since I wanted to learn the OS at a higher abstaction level, this is the main reason why I made this repo.

Don't get me wrong, the book [Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/), the [lectures](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/537/Spring2018/Discussion/videos.html), [this repo](https://github.com/palladian1/xv6-annotated/edit/main/README.md) are pretty fire, but I think they contain too much details that I find it hard to follow for the first time.

This repo will give you a more general approach to xv6 (which is just at the conceptualize level). My recommendation is you should check all the resources I've listed, and if you find it hard to get the idea behind any thing, you can checkout this repo (or ask LLMs LOL)
